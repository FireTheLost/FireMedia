# FireMedia

This is the source code for my biggest side project so far - FireMedia. It's basically a video sharing site I made to learn PHP and server side programming.

Date: Jan 3rd, 2021 - Sep 16th, 2021 (Exactly 256 Days)

This is the final version of FireMedia that I will write in PHP. However, in the future, I may rewrite this in some other language to make it more efficient, more user friendly, and more feature-rich.

Included are seperate folders, and each act independently from each other but are still related. I have also included the SQL code to create the database I used (on MySQL).
